This is an example of what the formatted text will look like with the current parameters.

Change one or more of the parameters above, then press the 'Format!' button.


Note: If you have 2 empty lines, like the 2 just above this line, they will act as a separator and print a Border line between the 2 paragraphs.

Notice how the Top Bar above (the row of Blue asterisks) and the Side Bars (also Blue asterisks) line up with this sample when it is formated.
